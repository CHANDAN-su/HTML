    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.
        It has been adapted from a <br> number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>
    
    <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes.
         It is <br> very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
        <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.</li>
        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, <br>
         chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment
         <br> and see what works for you.    </p>

         <h3>Storage</h3>

         <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for 
            <br> about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should 
            <br> definitely discard it.</p>

        <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>

        <h1>Important notice</h1>

        <p>On <strong>Sunday January 9th 2010</strong>, a gang of <em>goths</em>  were spotted stealing <strong><em>several garden jumpsuits</em></strong>           
            <br> gnomes from a shopping center in downtown <strong>Milwaukee</strong> . They were all  <em>wearing green</em>

            <br> information about this incident, please contact the police <strong>now</strong> .</p>
