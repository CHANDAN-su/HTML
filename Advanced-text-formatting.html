    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Life">
        <h3>What's is life</h3>
        <p>"What Is Life" is a song by English rock musician George Harrison from his 1970 triple album All Things Must
            Pass. In many countries, it was issued as the second single from the album, in February 1971, becoming a
            top-ten
            hit in the United States, Canada and elsewhere, and topping singles charts in Australia and Switzerland. In
            the
            United Kingdom, "What Is Life" appeared as the B-side to "My Sweet Lord", which was the best-selling single
            there of 1971. Harrison's backing musicians on the song include Eric Clapton and the entire Delaney & Bonnie
            and
            Friends band, with whom he had toured during the final months of the Beatles. Harrison co-produced the
            recording
            with Phil Spector, whose Wall of Sound production also employed a prominent string arrangement by John
            Barham
            and multiple acoustic rhythm guitars, played by Harrison's fellow Apple Records signings Badfinger.</p>
